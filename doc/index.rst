Sawtooth Lake Distributed MarketPlace
========================================================

**Intel Confidential -- DO NOT DISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PERMISSION**

The Sawtooh Lake Distributed MarketPlace Transaction implements a
decentralized ledger to facilitate verifiable exchange of digital
assets. The transaction family defines no intrinsic currency nor does it
attempt to enforce any particular value model on the assets exchanged;
it is completely agnostic of the potential meaning of any particular
asset. It records registration of assets by participants, offers for
exchange of assets amongst participants, and ultimately the transfer of
ownership of assets.
