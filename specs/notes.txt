Transfer 30 shares of Raiders from John to Sally

Transaction contains a reference to John's holding
Transaction contains a reference to Sally's holding
Transaction contains a quantity

Transaction contains authorization to decrement John's holding
Transaction contains authorization to increment Sally's holding

An address implies a public key

Version 1:
* John's holding is referenced by an address
* Sally's holding is referenced by an address
* The address of sally's holding is authorization of a right to pay
* The transaction is signed by John's private key which makes the
  originatorID of the transaction match the address stored in John's
  holding, equivalence of the originator id and the owner id in the
  holding proves that the owner authorizes the transaction

Problems with the simple version:
* the addresses imply a key associated with the holding, so the address
  becomes a reference to Sally & John not to the holdings
* addresses in the transaction refer back to the participants, if there
  is a participant object it will have an address that matches those in
  the transaction. everyone will know who performed the transaction so
  there is no anonymity at all

Version 2:
* John's holding is referenced by a holding id, the holding has John's
  address as its owner
* Sally's holding is referenced by a holding id, the holding has Sally's
  address as its owner
* The address of sally's holding is authorization of a right to pay
* The transaction is signed by John's private key which makes the
  originatorID of the transaction match the address stored in John's
  holding, equivalence of the originator id and the owner id in the
  holding proves that the owner authorizes the transaction
