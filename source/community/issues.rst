Reporting Issues
-----------------

This is a great way to contribute. Before reporting an issue, please review
current open issues to see if there are any matches. If there is a match,
comment with a +1, or "Also seeing this issue".
If any environment details differ, please add those with your comment to the
matching issue.

If you would like, you could also bring up the issue on
https://inteldl.slack.com for initial feedback before submitting the issue
in Github.

Guidelines for submitting an issue with good information is located at
:doc:`how_to_report_issues`.

A team member will be assigned to review the issue and will respond to the
contributor with questions and clarifications, as needed. This may result in:

* Issues determined to be new features will move into our project backlog and
  the contributor will be notified
* Issues confirmed be a bug, but not a current priority, will move into the
  project backlog and the contributor will be notified
* Issues confirmed to be a bug, that needs immediate attention, will be assigned
  to a team member to resolve. The team member may contact the contributor for
  additional information
* Issue determined to be a bug, but will not be fixed for a variety of reasons
  (such as working as designed). The contributor will be notified

**Notes on GitHub Usage**

It's worth noting that we don't use all the native GitHub features for issue
management. For instance, it's uncommon for us to assign issues to the developer
who will address it. Here are notes on what we do use.

**Issue Labels**

Distributed Ledger maintainers have a set of labels we'll use to keep up with
issues that are organized:

* **bug** - the classic definition of missing or misbehaving code from existing
  functionality (this includes malfunctioning tests)
* **feature request** - any new functionality or improvements/enhancements to
  existing functionality. Note that we use a single term for this (instead of
  both feature & enhancement labels) since it's prioritized in identical ways
  during sprint planning
* **question** - discussions related to Distribute Ledger, its administration
  or other details that do not outline how to address the request
* **RFC** - short for`request for comment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments>`_ .
  These are discussions of Distributed Ledger features requests that include
  detailed opinions of implementation that are up for discussion

We also add contextual notes we'll use to provide more information regarding
an issue:

* **in progress** - we're taking action (right now). It's best not to develop
  your own solution to an issue in this state. Comments are welcome
* **help wanted** - A useful flag to show this issue would benefit from
  community support. Please comment or, if it's not in progress, say you'd like
  to take on the request
* **on hold** - An idea that gained momentum but has not yet been put into a
  maintainer's queue to complete. Used to inform any trackers of this status
* **tracked** - This issue is in the project backlog for the team working on
  Distributed Ledger
* **duplicate** - Used to tag issues which are identical to other issues
  _OR_ which are resolved by the same fix of another issue (either case)
* **wontfix** - The universal sign that we won't fix this issue. This tag is
  important to use as we separate out the nice-to-have features from our
  strategic direction
